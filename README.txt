Hello. Here is my code sample. This was a project from my Algorithms Design course in which we implemented both Prim's
and Kruskal's Algorithms to generate a Minimum Spanning Tree that was turned into a maze. Then we had to solve it.


To run it:

make run
./a.out numRows numCols

* numRows is an Int
* numCols is an Int
